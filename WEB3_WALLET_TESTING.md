   - Edge: Available in Microsoft Edge Add-ons

2. Set up MetaMask wallet (if not already done)
   - Create new wallet or import existing one
   - Switch to any test network (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli) for testing
   - Or use Ethereum Mainnet with your actual wallet

### Testing Steps

After successful connection, you should see:
- ✅ Your wallet address (truncated format: 0x1234...5678)
- ✅ Your ETH balance
- ✅ Green "Connected" status with checkmark
- ✅ "Disconnect" button

#### 4. Test Features

**Copy Address:**

```
MetaMask available: true
Wallet connected: 0x...
Balance: X.XXXX ETH
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 2: Connection request not appearing**
- Solution: Click MetaMask icon in browser toolbar
- Make sure MetaMask is unlocked
- Refresh page and try again

**Issue 3: Balance showing 0.0000 ETH**
- This is normal if testing with empty wallet
- Add test ETH from faucet (for test networks)

**Issue 4: "Failed to connect wallet" error**
- Check if MetaMask is unlocked
- Try disconnecting any other dApps
- Clear browser cache and try again

## 🔗 WalletConnect Testing

### Note: WalletConnect Implementation
The WalletConnect button is currently a placeholder. To fully test:

1. Need to set up WalletConnect Cloud project at: https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
2. Get Project ID
3. Configure in the WalletPage.js component
4. Then can connect using mobile wallets (Trust Wallet, Rainbow, etc.)

## 🧪 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Test Transaction Signing (Future)
Once backend transaction endpoints are ready:
1. Click "Send Crypto" button
2. Enter recipient address and amount
3. Sign transaction in MetaMask
4. Verify transaction on blockchain

### Test Network Switching
1. Open MetaMask
2. Switch networks (Mainnet ↔ Testnet)
3. Wallet page should update balance automatically

### Test Multiple Accounts
1. Switch accounts in MetaMask
2. Disconnect and reconnect
3. Verify new account address and balance display

## 📱 Mobile Testing

### For Mobile Browsers with MetaMask Mobile:
1. Open https://cannabis-press.preview.emergentagent.com/wallet in MetaMask mobile browser
2. Tap "Connect MetaMask"
3. Approve connection
4. Test same features as desktop
